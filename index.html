       <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>I'm Sara Barker, an Information Science Major pursuing an Information Technology Minor. 
         I attend Michigan State University and this is my 4th and final year pursuing my undergraduate degree. 
         I have a large amount of experience in coding in languages such as HTML, C++, C#, Java, and Python. 
         I enjoy playing video games and watching shows and movies, as well as spending time with my friends and pursuing creative endeavors such as creating art, as well as learning new skills in my free time. 
         Some of my goals are to improve on my coding skill and becoming more confident in the languages I have experience in, as well as to learn new spoken languages. 
         I also hope to find a career in Data Analysis in the future, as that is my focus in my Information Science Major, and I have a large interest in data and data analysis. </p>
